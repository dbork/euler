# this criterion can be phrased in terms of means, eg, for 8
# geom(1, 1, 2, 4) = 8^(1/4) and arith(1, 1, 2, 4) = 8/4 = 2.

# fact 2: you can add ones to rectify any small difference between the
# sum and product, which could be useful...

# ok, let prod - sum = d, and any solution must have d = 0.
# move a: add a one. d -= 1
# move b: add one to some k in the factorization.
