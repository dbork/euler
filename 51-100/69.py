# lol i guessed 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 = 510510
# and it worked. well, guess is a strong word, it makes pretty compelling
# sense -- multiplying something by a prime already in its prime
# factorization increases n without changing phi(n), and the most efficient
# primes are the smallest ones
print 510510
